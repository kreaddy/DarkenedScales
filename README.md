# Darkened Scales
A mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous that tweaks the Corrupted Gold Dragon mythic path. Heavy WIP, don't use.

Current stuff:

* Alignment is locked to 1 step of CE when becoming corrupt.

TODO:

* Change holy conversion to unholy.
* Spellbook.
* Make it all work with Path of Bling.
* Cosmetic changes, like text and mythic border art.
* Maybe some additional mechanic based on a chromatic dragon of choice? idk
